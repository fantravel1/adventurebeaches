# ADVENTUREBEACHES.COM — README (v1)
**Where the coastline gets dangerous (and beautiful).**  
**Go where the land breaks.**

AdventureBeaches is not a beach travel site.

It is a **global atlas of wild coastlines and high-awe beaches** — built for people who seek movement, challenge, story, and living nature.

This README defines the **core philosophy, scoring systems, site architecture, page templates, tone, and guardrails** for AdventureBeaches.

---

## 0) The Core Reframe (Non‑Negotiable)

### Not all beaches are for laying down.

AdventureBeaches is for:

- people who want movement  
- people who want awe  
- people who want stories  
- people who want nature to feel alive  

If a beach is primarily about towels, cocktails, or passive lounging, it does not belong here.

AdventureBeaches exists to say:

> **“This beach will stay with you for the rest of your life — if you respect it.”**

---

## 1) What AdventureBeaches Is (and Is Not)

### AdventureBeaches IS:
- a global directory of **adventure‑forward beaches**
- an **AdventureScore™ index**
- a **risk‑aware exploration guide**
- an **access‑reality intelligence system**
- a high‑trust authority on wild coastlines
- a storytelling platform rooted in geography and consequence

### AdventureBeaches is NOT:
- a resort or luxury beach site  
- an influencer photo blog  
- a generic “best beaches” list factory  
- a thrill‑seeking death‑porn site  
- a fear‑based safety manual  

If a page feels reckless, romanticized, or resort‑polished — it’s wrong.

---

## 2) The Adventure Beach Index (Core IP)

### Every beach receives two distinct ratings

#### 1. AdventureScore™ (1–100)
Measures **how unforgettable and active** the experience is.

#### 2. Risk Level (1–10)
Measures **objective danger**, clearly and honestly.

These scores must never be blended.

Adventure without honesty destroys trust.

---

## 3) AdventureScore™ (Canonical Factors)

Every AdventureScore™ is derived from:

- **Uniqueness** (geological, ecological, cultural)
- **Activities Possible** (hiking, jumping, paddling, exploring, viewing)
- **Difficulty** (physical and technical)
- **Access Challenge** (navigation, timing, terrain)
- **Weather Drama** (storms, wind, seasonal intensity)
- **Wildlife Encounters**
- **Scenery Intensity**
- **Remoteness**
- **“You Will Remember This Forever” Factor**

### Philosophy
- Beauty alone is not adventure.
- Difficulty without meaning is not adventure.
- Risk must be acknowledged, not glamorized.
- The coast is alive. That’s the point.

---

## 4) Risk Level (1–10) — Absolute Clarity

Risk Level is displayed **separately and prominently**.

### Risk Level reflects:
- rip currents  
- cliff exposure  
- rockfall  
- tidal traps  
- wave violence  
- wildlife proximity  
- rescue availability  

### Rule
AdventureBeaches **never** hides risk to increase clicks.

Adult readers deserve adult information.
